# Deep-Scoring-Project  
Research Project with Dr. Frank Hsu of Fordham University.
The aim of this project is to take a set of scoring systems and get a better performance at each layer. 
We start with a set of scoring systems and combine them in interesting ways that aim to increase performance.
No matter the alteration each new layer is its self a scoring system. 
If we can get a layer that improves the accuracy of previous layer consistently, we can keep iterating it until it converges to some maximum.
If it works as intended, this will essentially allow us to have an easy way to ensemble many sub-par models into a high performing one.
